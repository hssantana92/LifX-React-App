### A LifX Smart Light Web Application.

Click [here](https://www.google.com) for live demo

This web application was coded in JavaScript with React.js and the LifX HTTP API. This little project was one of my first personal projects and my second venture into the React library and was used to control one of my smart lights from anywhere in the world with the use of an API key. I have since started a much larger Smart Light Controller project using the LifX LAN protocol which can be found on my Github profile.

### Getting Started

A screen is displayed requesting an API Key which is created when setting up the LifX bulb

### Control Page

Once a valid API Key is entered, the controller presents itself

A light can then be clicked on and the following controls are displayed.
