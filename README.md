### A LifX Smart Light Web Application.

This web application was coded in JavaScript with React.js and the LifX HTTP API. This little project was one of my first personal projects and my second venture into the React library and was used to control one of my smart lights from anywhere in the world with the use of an API key. I have since started a much larger Smart Light Controller project using the LifX LAN protocol which can be found on my Github profile.

### Getting Started

A screen is displayed requesting an API Key which is created when setting up the LifX bulb
